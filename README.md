## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

`gem 'site_hook'`

And then execute:

`$ bundle`

Or install it yourself as:

`gem install site_hook --user-install # as a user`
`sudo gem install site_hook # as a sudoer`
`gem install site_hook # as root`

## Usage

You'll need to setup a `~/.jph-rc` file and make a `~/.jph/` directory. The file is for runtime configuration, and the directory is used for logging and debugging.
